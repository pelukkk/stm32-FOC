# Field-Oriented Control (FOC) on STM32 From Scratch

This project demonstrates a complete, low-level implementation of **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)** for controlling a **BLDC motor** using an **STM32F4 microcontroller**, without relying on high-level motor control libraries.

Built using **PlatformIO**, **STM32 HAL/LL drivers**, and **FreeRTOS**, this project is designed for learning and practical experimentation in precision motor control.
